      <h3 style="margin-bottom:24px;padding-bottom:16px;border-bottom:2px solid var(--sage-light);">About Acupuncture</h3>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Does acupuncture hurt?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Most patients feel minimal discomfort. Acupuncture needles are extremely thin — roughly the width of a human hair, much thinner than injection needles. You may feel a brief tingling, warmth, or dull ache at certain points, which is considered a normal and positive sign that the treatment is working. Many patients find the experience deeply relaxing and even fall asleep during sessions.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What conditions can acupuncture treat?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Acupuncture is recognized by the World Health Organization for treating dozens of conditions including: chronic and acute pain, migraines and headaches, back and neck pain, sciatica, arthritis, anxiety and depression, insomnia, digestive disorders, allergies, menstrual irregularities, infertility support, and post-surgical recovery. During your consultation, we'll assess whether acupuncture is appropriate for your specific needs.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How many sessions will I need?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">This varies by condition and individual response. Acute issues (like a recent injury) may improve in 3–5 sessions. Chronic conditions (like long-term back pain or anxiety) often benefit from a course of 8–12 sessions, followed by maintenance treatments. Your practitioner will create a personalized plan during your initial consultation and adjust it based on your progress.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is acupuncture safe?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes. When performed by trained practitioners using sterile, single-use disposable needles, acupuncture is extremely safe. Side effects are rare and typically mild (occasional slight bruising or temporary soreness at needle sites). At Wongu Health Center, all treatments — including student intern sessions — are supervised by licensed Oriental Medicine Doctors.</div></div>
      </div>

      <h3 style="margin:48px 0 24px;padding-bottom:16px;border-bottom:2px solid var(--sage-light);">About Our Clinic</h3>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is a university teaching clinic?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Wongu Health Center is the public clinic of Wongu University of Oriental Medicine. Advanced students (clinical interns) gain hands-on experience by treating real patients under the direct supervision of licensed OMDs. This model — similar to teaching hospitals in conventional medicine — allows us to offer high-quality treatments at significantly reduced costs.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is the student clinic safe?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Absolutely. Every student intern treatment is directly supervised by a licensed OMD who is physically present throughout your session. The supervisor reviews all diagnoses, approves all treatment plans, and verifies all needle placements. Our interns have completed hundreds of hours of academic and practical training before they begin treating patients.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What's the difference between the student clinic and a licensed OMD session?<span class="faq-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"><path d="M12 5v14M5 12h14"/></svg></span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Intern sessions are performed by 3rd and 4th-year graduate students under direct faculty supervision — initial visits are $80 (1.5–2 hours), follow-ups are $50 (~1 hour). Licensed OMD sessions are performed by board-certified practitioners who work independently — initial visits are $120 (~1 hour), follow-ups are $80 (30–55 minutes). The intern clinic is ideal for general wellness and maintenance, while OMD sessions are recommended for complex or acute conditions.</div></div>

        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">After scheduling, you'll receive an email with directions to enter your personal contact and medical information into our secure system. Do not arrive on an empty stomach — eat a light snack or meal before your appointment. Drink plenty of water before and after your treatment. Wear comfortable clothing that allows access to your arms and legs. Bring a list of any medications or supplements you're currently taking.</div></div>

      <div class="faq-item">

        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Session lengths vary by provider. Intern initial visits take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours (including a comprehensive medical history), with follow-ups around 1 hour. OMD initial visits are approximately 1 hour, with follow-ups running 30 to 55 minutes. At each visit, your practitioner will conduct a 15–20 minute intake, including tongue and pulse diagnosis, followed by your treatment. A custom herbal formula may be prepared afterward. We recommend arriving 10 minutes early for your first appointment.</div></div>
