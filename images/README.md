## Photo Tips
- Shoot in landscape (4:3 ratio) for content sections, square for headshots
- Use natural lighting if possible — avoid harsh flash
- Keep backgrounds clean and uncluttered
- Get written patient consent for any photos showing patients
- Compress images before uploading (use tinypng.com or squoosh.app)
- Save as .jpg for photos, .png only if transparency is needed
- Aim for 100-300KB per image after compression for fast loading
